This repo contains files and code to analyse Digital Propensity Index (DPI) report based on the 2021 census.  It maps the index to Output Area (OA) classification (the profile of household in the area) and also the Urban/Rural classification.

We then filter out the areas which have higher DPI and ouputs two files, one for  Urban and one for Rural.  

Note: the LSOA21_TO_OA_MAPPING file "PCD_OA21_LSOA21_MSOA21_LAD_MAY23_UK_LU.csv" is not in the repo, please download from https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ons::postcode-to-oa-2021-to-lsoa-to-msoa-to-lad-may-2023-best-fit-lookup-in-the-uk/about
